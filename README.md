# Intro-to-GoLang
Repository for HackBU Demo on Go

Most of the code in this demo is adopted from 
[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_overview.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_overview.htm) 
and 
[https://tour.golang.org](https://tour.golang.org). These are great resources
to start learning Go on your own.

## Motivation
Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to 
generate executable binaries. The Go programming language was announced in 
November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.

Some of the most important features of Go programming are listed below âˆ’
* Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages. 
For example, type inference (x := 0 is valid declaration of a variable x 
of type int)
* Compilation time is fast.
* Built-in concurrency support: lightweight processes (via go routines), 
channels, select statement.
* Go programs are simple, concise, and safe.

## Setting Up
To make it easy for everyone to follow along, just head to
[https://repl.it/languages/go](https://repl.it/languages/go) so you can 
code without installing anything.

To install Go on your machine, head to their main website: 
[https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

If you'd like help installing Go or setting anything up, feel free to come
up and ask questions after the talk!

## Starting out
I'll be going through some basic code examples to introduce common programming
practices in Go.

### Hello World
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

### Types


| Type  | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|Boolean|True or False values|
|Numeric|Integers or floating point values|
|String |Immutable sequences of bytes|
|Derived|Pointer types, Array types, Struct types, Function types, etc. |

| Integer Types |
|---------------|
|uint8|
|uint16|
|uint32|
|uint64|
|int8|
|int16|
|int32|
|int64|

| Floating-Point Types |
|----------------------|
|float32|
|float64|
|complex64|
|complex128|

|Other Numeric Types|
|-------------------|
|byte|same as uint8|
|rune|same as int32|
|uint|32 or 64bit depending on system|
|int|32 or 64bit depending on systme|
|uintptr|special type to consider pointer as a uint for easier arithmetic|

Here we see some different ways to initialize variables of different types
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2 // explicit type declaration
	k := 3 // implicit type declaration
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!" // mixed-type implicit declaration

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}

```
Additionally you can also get the type of a variable with %T format specifier

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var x float64
	x = 20.0
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Printf("x is of type %T\n", x)
}
```

Here is an example of various types in Go being used, as well as demonstrating how
you can use import() and var() to import various things and declare many variables
without having to retype too much:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/cmplx"
)

var (
	ToBe   bool       = false
	MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
	z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

#### Constants

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	const LENGTH int = 10
	const WIDTH int = 5
	var area int

	area = LENGTH * WIDTH
	fmt.Printf("value of area : %d", area)
}
```

### Operators
#### Arithmetic Operators
|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|+|Adds two operands|
|-|Subtracts second operand from first operand|
|\*|Multiplies operands together|
|/|Divides first operand by second operand|
|%|Modulus operator - gives remainder of division|
|++|Increments value by 1|
|--|Decrements value by 1|

#### Relational Operators

|Operator|
|--------|
|==|
|<=|
|>=|
|<|
|>|
|!=|
|--|

#### Logical Operators

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|&&|AND|
|\|\||OR|
|!|NOT|


#### Others

Find documentation on all operators here:
[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_operators.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_operators.htm)


### Functions

Functions are similar to most other languages, one noticable difference
being that the return type is at the end of the function header:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

However, one neat trick is that if all parameters are of the same type,
you can just put the type at the end of the parameters as seen below:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

You can also return multiple things in Go which you can't
do in every language (without some workaround)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

### Misc Variable Stuff

#### Default Values
Variables that are declared with no initial value are
given a value of "zero" - depending on what that means
for the given type. Here's some example default type values
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var (
		i int
		f float64
		b bool
		s string
	)
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}

```

You can also cast variables to other types with type(var):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	// Pythagorean Theorem: z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```



### Channels and Go-Routines
Go has a type called "Channel" which are pipes that connect concurrent
Go routines (like threads). You can send values into a channel from one routine
and receive that value from the channel in another routine with the channel
operator `<-`.

**By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This 
allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition 
variables.** - Part of why Go is cool!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
	sum := 0 // implicit declaration of int sum to 0
	for _, v := range s { // iterate through array passed into function
		sum += v		  // add values in array to total sum
	}
	c <- sum // send sum to channel c
}

func main() {
	s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

	c := make(chan int) // Create channel that holds ints

	// 'go' keyword starts new go-routine on the function that comes after
	go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c) // One routine sum up first half
	go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c) // Second routine sum up second half
	x, y := <-c, <-c // receive from c

	fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}
```



### Decision Making
![](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/images/decision_making.jpg)

#### If Statement
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  /* local variable definition */
  var a int = 10

    /* check the boolean condition using if statement */
    if( a < 20 ) {
        /* if condition is true then print the following */
        fmt.Printf("a is less than 20\n" )
    }
    fmt.Printf("value of a is : %d\n", a)
}
```
#### If...Else Statement
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	/* local variable definition */
	var a int = 100;

	/* check the boolean condition */
	if( a < 20 ) {
		/* if condition is true then print the following */
		fmt.Printf("a is less than 20\n" );
	} else {
		/* if condition is false then print the following */
		fmt.Printf("a is not less than 20\n" );
	}
	fmt.Printf("value of a is : %d\n", a);
}
```
#### Nested If Statement
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	/* local variable definition */
	var a int = 100
		var b int = 200

		/* check the boolean condition */
		if( a == 100 ) {
			/* if condition is true then check the following */
			if( b == 200 )  {
				/* if condition is true then print the following */
				fmt.Printf("Value of a is 100 and b is 200\n" );
			}
		}
	fmt.Printf("Exact value of a is : %d\n", a );
	fmt.Printf("Exact value of b is : %d\n", b );
}
```
#### Switch Statement
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	/* local variable definition */
	var grade string = "B"
	var marks int = 90

	switch marks {
		case 90: grade = "A"
		case 80: grade = "B"
		case 50,60,70 : grade = "C"
		default: grade = "D"  
	}
	switch {
		case grade == "A" :
			fmt.Printf("Excellent!\n" )     
		case grade == "B", grade == "C" :
			fmt.Printf("Well done\n" )      
		case grade == "D" :
			fmt.Printf("You passed\n" )      
		case grade == "F":
			fmt.Printf("Better try again\n" )
		default:
			fmt.Printf("Invalid grade\n" );
	}
	fmt.Printf("Your grade is  %s\n", grade );      
}
```
#### Select Statement


A select statement is like a switch statement but specifically for channels.


```go

```
